Fixing up a car to drive in it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up, up and up

Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up, up and up


See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood 
It's in your blood, it's in your blood
Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
"Sitting with the poison takes away the pain"
Up and up, up and up it's saying


We're gonna get it, get it together, I know
I'm gonna get it, get it together somehow
We're gonna get it, get it together and flower
Woah, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We're gonna get it, get it together I know
We're gonna get it, get it together and flow
I'm gonna get it, get it together and go
Up and up and up
